# drone-zone üêù
Experimenting with game development using the dinosaur of programming languages, i.e. C.

### Dependencies
```bash
sudo apt install build-essential libsdl2-dev libsdl2-ttf-dev libsdl2-gfx-dev libm-dev
```
As of now, the program needs `Sigmar-Regular.ttf` to be present in the same directory (otherwise weird errors would occur). Be sure to download it from the repository code & files above.

### Compilation
```bash
gcc -o dronezone dronezone.c -lm $(sdl2-config --cflags --libs) $(pkg-config --cflags --libs SDL2_ttf SDL2_gfx)
```

### Launching
```bash
 ./dronezone 
```

### Debugging

 gdb ./dronezone 
```
